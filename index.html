        <p>The current conflict of interest rule only deals with conflicts at meetings, which doesn't allow for the possibility of decisions being taken outwith meetings.</p>
        <p>I've suggested a broad description of what a conflict of interest is, partly to avoid reproducing what the current constitution says about who's connected with a council member. It's a very odd proposition because it doesn't bear to be exhaustive and begs more questions than it answers, at least to my mind.</p>
        <p>Current constitution says being staff member can't create a conflict of interest. Necessary at the moment because staff are ex officio members. Desirable going forward? If a Council member also happens to be a teacher and the Council's discussing something relevant to teaching conditions, should that be a declarable conflict?</p>

     <p>The current constitution has no mechanism to rebuff a request by 3 council members for what it calls an extraordinary meeting? Is the requirement to get 3 members to back the call safeguard enough against abuse? In case not, I have offered a limited power for the chair to say no to a special meeting. The grounds on which the chair can say no are constrained and the chair has to tell all members of the decision to say no. If members are unhappy with the chair's reasoning, they can get that on the agenda for the next ordinary meeting (see article b015), but what they can't do is request another extraordinary meeting to discuss the refusal of the last request because then there'd be a risk of getting stuck in a never ending loop.</p>
    <p>If this restriction on requests for special meetings is wanted, is a 6 month period of limitations on retreading the same ground ok?</p>

    <div class="drafterCommentary">
      <p>This is a stab at giving the chair some way of keeping meetings somewhat on the rails by at least stopping probelmatic, or repetitious, subjects getting on the agenda. It doesn't stop things being raised as AOB at the end of a meeting, but coming at the end of the meeting gives the presiding member the way out of ending the meeting rather than trying to eject someone.</p>
      <p>The 10 days proposed in paragraph (4)(b) is to accommodate the fact that the agenda has to be ready at the point of giving notice of the meeting - see article b005 for the timescales for that.</p>
      <p>I haven't expressly included a requirement to allow for AOB at the end of the agenda of at least all ordinary meetings. Would it be desirable to spell that out? The current constitution says that any member of the Parent Forum can raise any topic for discussion at a meeting and that any other business may be transacted at an ordinary meeting. Perhaps some will feel that the provisions allowing Forum members to have things put on the agenda is a watering down of that entitlement if it's not made explicit that they'll also get a chance at the end of meetings.</p>
      <p>The current constitution's rule that AOB will be taken says it's at the chair's discretion, but if there isn't time for it it has to go on the agenda for the next meeting. I've left out that requirement to put it on the agenda for the next meeting. The person who wants to discuss at the next meeting can request that under paragraph (3), which comes with a safety valve for problem agenda items.</p>

         <p>Currently the constitution only deals with giving notice to Council members. That seems odd given that it also says that any member of the Parent Forum can raise an issue at a meeting and that meetings are to be public. So I've suggested a requirement to give notice to the world, rather than just members. How that's fulfilled is left to the Council. A post on the website, Facebook or what have you would surely do.

         <p>The list of mandatory invitees replaces the current constition's class of non-voting members. The headteacher's representative isn't mentioned, because the invite can be sent to the headteacher and then it's up to her whether to send a representative - the meetings are open to all anyway.</p>
         <p>The current constitution's class of non-voting members also includes a representative of every sub-group. As we discussed I don't really know what it means by sub-group. Is there anyone, like the head of the PTA, who should be on the mandatory invite list who was previously caught by that limb of the non-voting members category?</p>
         <p>Pupil council is in square brackets because I don't know what it is and need to consider further whether a definition should be added.</p>
         <p>The list of people to consider inviting (paragraph (3)) is much the same as in the current constitution. A couple of points to note:</p>
         <ul><li>The current constitution mentions a rep of the Scottish Government. I haven't included that. Should I?</li>
             <li>The current constitution refers to the local MSP. Of course we have a constitutency and regional MSPs, I've assumed consideration should be given to inviting them all.</li>
             <li>The current constitution says that local councillors should be considered as possible invitees. But it also makes them non-voting members, which means they have to be given notice of the meetings anyway. I've omitted them from the list on the basis they're already mandatory invitees.</li>

        <p>The current constitution doesn't have a way of dealing with the situtation of there being no chair or vice chair. It's probably unlikely it'll happen, but it would be a real problem if it did because the current constitution says the Council has to appoint members to those posts but the Council can't meet to do so if there's no chair or vice chair because of the quoracy rule (you'll notice I've added some latitude there too). Absent a chair or vice chair I've suggested the oldest member presides meantime - it's not totally comfortable going by age but what else can be used? Age has been used in situations like this for some serious public bodies, recently it was how we catered for the possibility of the chair of the Parole Board going down with Covid.</p>

          <p>When we met a distaste for the current constitution's term 'clerk' was expressed. Is secretary preferable? Clerk is the term the 2006 Act uses, and there are some legal consequences to being 'the clerk', but if secretary is preferred we can just explain in the interpretation provision at the end that secretary is clerk in 2006 Act terms.</p>

          <p>We discussed giving the presiding member a power to remove members from meetings, but section 9 doesn't allow that and the constitution can't supersede the law in this area.

          <p>Current constitution says member with conflict of interest has to withdraw from meeting. Not clear what that means. If it means leave, I don't think that's legal standing what the 2006 Act says about the rights of people to attend council meetings.</p>
          <p>Should the person be barred from taking part in discussion of the matter? Barring from voting is one thing, but saying they can't talk about the issue seems extreme. Oddly it means a member's in a worst position than a member of the parent Forum who can presumably turn up and say whatever regardless of conflict of interest. If the member's stated they have a conflict, perhaps that's enough because others will know he or she is speaking against that background?</p>
          <p>Note the fact someone isn't participating doesn't mean they're to be ignored for the purpose of deciding if the meeting's quorate. Is that ok?</p>
          <p>Not participating does affect the rule about who's to preside, so if the chair had a conflict would have to stop presiding over that part of the meeting. Is that ok? The current constitution doesn't spell it out, but I assume that's part of what withdrawing from a meeting means.</p>

        <p>This is a bit different from current constitution. The stuff about appointing up to 7 members every 2 years and inviting applications for appointment every 2 years is gone. What's the point of it? If there are going to be vacancies, why not just fill however many there are?</p>
        <p>I've suggested getting rid of the idea that a co-opted member serves out the end of the term of the routinely appointed member that the co-opted member replaces. In the first place, it's not clear that every co-opted member will be replacing a routinely appointed member. Also, if multiple routinely appointed members stand down at once, who decides which co-opted member is a replacement for whom? And things get really messy if co-opted members get brought on to replace co-opted members. So why not say co-opted members come on board till the start of the new school year? That'll mean there's an imminent vacancy, which will trigger the requirement to invite routine application appointments in June. The co-opted member can then apply and become a normal member like everyone else from the start of the new school year - or not in the unlikely event that there's a vote and forum members choose someone else &emdash; it seems only democratic to allow for the possibility.</p>
        <p>Should there be an ability to take a resignation from someone without a power of attorney for the resigning member? Unlikely to come up often, but would seem unwelcome to have to go to forum in those circumstances.</p>

      <h1>End note</h1>
      <p>For the time being, there are some things from the current constitution that I haven't included:</p>
      <ol><li>The objectives section. It's a mix of functions and principles. To the extent that it describes functions, it's treading ground already covered by the 2006 Act - I've linked explicitly to the functions section in the 2006 Act in the preamble. Perhaps there is a desire, if only for presentational reasons, to keep some of the principles (e.g. around inclusivity).</li>
          <li>Appendix 1 has a list of rights and duties of the Council. How this sits with the objectives section (much less the 2006 Act) I don't know. Again, fair enough if there are bits worth salvaging, they can be weaved together with the objectives material into something more coherent.</li>
          <li>Rule that meetings - I assume council, not parent forum - to be in school's main building and in evenings (undefined) unless council agrees otherwise. Does that need to be a rule?</li>
          <li>Requirement for chair to approve minutes before they can be circulated. Is that wanted or can it be left to agreement between those involved - e.g. if chair's on holiday and wasn't at meeting, perhaps other members can check the minutes?</li>
          <li>Stuff in the annex under heading "access to information", which qualifies the transparency provision (b012).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I haven't proof read this yet, and there are various low-level inconsistencies to iron out, e.g. using "Council" or "Parent Council" at least in the first appearance in an article, etc.</p>
